\section{Introduction}

Call-by-need evaluation is a formalization of the idea that work
should be delayed until needed, and performed only once.  Existing
implementations of call-by-need take care in \emph{packaging} a delayed
computation, or \emph{thunk}, by building a closure with an array that contains
the bindings of all free variables \cite{jonesstg,boquist1997grin}. The overhead
induced by this operation is well known, and is one reason existing implementations
avoid thunks wherever possible \cite{johnsson1984efficient}. The key insight of
our Cactus Environment ($\mathcal{\mathcal{C} \mskip -4mu \mathcal{E}}$) Machine is that this overhead can be
minimized by only recording a location in a shared environment.

As an example, consider the application $f \; e$. In existing call-by-need
implementations, e.g., the STG machine\cite{jonesstg}, a closure with a flat
environment will be constructed for $e$.  Doing so incurs a time and memory cost
proportional to the number of free variables of $e$. \footnote{In some
implementations, these are lambda-lifted to be formal parameters, but the
principle is the same.} We minimize this packaging cost by recording a
location in a shared environment, which requires only two
machine words (and two instructions) for the thunk: one for the code pointer,
and one for the environment pointer. One way to think about the approach is that
it is \emph{lazier} about lazy evaluation: in the case that $e$ is unneeded, the
work to package it in a thunk is entirely wasted. In the spirit of lazy
evaluation, we attempt to minimize this potentially unnecessary work.  

The main contributions of the paper are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A big-step calculus and small-step abstract machine that formalize the
notion of a shared environment for call-by-need evaluation using an explicitly
shared environment (Section~\ref{sec:calc}).
\item A simple implementation of the abstract machine that compiles to x86
assembly with a preliminary evaluation that shows performance comparable to
existing implementations (Sections~\ref{sec:impl} and~\ref{sec:eval}).
\end{itemize}

Section~\ref{sec:back} reviews relevant background material, and
Section~\ref{sec:env} discusses the current landscape of environment
representations, highlighting the opportunity for combining shared environments
with lazy evaluation.  We then provide some intuition for why this might be
combination might be desirable, and formalize the connection between call-by-need
evaluation and shared environments in a calculus (Section~\ref{sec:calc}).
Section~\ref{sec:mach} uses the calculus to derive a novel abstract machine,
the $\mathcal{\mathcal{C} \mskip -4mu \mathcal{E}}$ machine, explains how
$\mathcal{\mathcal{C} \mskip -4mu \mathcal{E}}$ uses the shared environment in
a natural way to implement lazy evaluation, and gives its formal semantics.  We
then describe a straightforward implementation of $\mathcal{\mathcal{C} \mskip
-4mu \mathcal{E}}$ in Section~\ref{sec:impl}, extended with machine literals
and primitive operations, and compiling directly to native code. We evaluate the
implementation in Section~\ref{sec:eval}, showing that it is capable of
performing comparably to existing implementations despite lacking several
common optimizations, and we discuss the results. We discuss related work, the
limitations of our approach, and some ideas for future work in
Section~\ref{sec:disc}, and conclude the paper in Section~\ref{sec:conc}.
