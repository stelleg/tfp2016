\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}

We would like the reader to take a few key points from this paper. First, a
shared environment, explicitly represented as a cactus stack, forms a natural
way to share computation, as required by lazy evaluation. Second, the
formalization of this idea in a calculus, along with an abstract machine are two
of the primary contributions of this paper. Third, the abstract machine can be
implemented as a compiler in a straightforward way, yielding reasonable
performance, even without standard optimizations and extensions.
