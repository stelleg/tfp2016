\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}

We would like the reader to take a few key points from this paper. First, a
shared environment, explicitly represented as a cactus stack, is a natural
way to share the results of computation as required by lazy evaluation. Second,
this approach is in a sense \emph{lazier} about lazy evaluation in that it
avoids some unnecessary packaging work. Third, this approach can be formalized
in both big-step and small-step semantics. Fourth, the abstract machine can be
implemented as a compiler in a straightforward way, yielding performance
comparable to existing implementations.
