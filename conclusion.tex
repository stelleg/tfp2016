\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conc}

We would like the reader to take a few key points from this paper. First, a
shared environment, explicitly represented as a cactus stack, is a natural
way to share the results of computation as required by lazy evaluation. Second,
this approach can be formalized in both big-step and small-step semantics.
Third, the abstract machine can be implemented as a compiler in a
straightforward way, yielding performance comparable to existing
implementations.
